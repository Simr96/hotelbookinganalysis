Hotel Cancellation Analysis
This project aims to compare the features of city hotels and resort hotels to identify the reasons behind their cancellations. The analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing cancellation rates in different types of hotels.

Project Overview
The project involved collecting and analyzing data from city hotels and resort hotels, focusing on cancellation patterns and related features. The analysis aimed to answer questions such as:

What are the primary reasons for cancellations in city hotels and resort hotels?
Are there any notable differences in cancellation rates between the two types of hotels?
How do features like booking duration, room type, and lead time affect cancellation likelihood?
Data Collection and Analysis
Data was sourced from hotel booking datasets, including information on bookings, cancellations, hotel features, and customer details. The data was cleaned, processed, and analyzed using statistical methods and data visualization techniques.

Key steps in the analysis process:

Data cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and formatting data for analysis.
Exploratory data analysis: Exploring the distribution of cancellations, identifying patterns, and conducting statistical tests.
Feature comparison: Comparing relevant features between city hotels and resort hotels to understand potential drivers of cancellations.
Cancellation prediction: Building predictive models to determine the likelihood of cancellations based on various factors.
Report generation: Summarizing findings, insights, and recommendations in a comprehensive report.
Results and Recommendations
The analysis revealed important insights regarding cancellation patterns in city hotels and resort hotels. Key findings include:

City hotels had a higher overall cancellation rate compared to resort hotels.
Booking duration and lead time were identified as significant factors influencing cancellation likelihood.
Specific room types showed varying cancellation rates, indicating potential areas for improvement.
Based on these findings, the following recommendations are proposed:

Implement targeted strategies to reduce cancellations in city hotels, such as flexible cancellation policies or personalized offers for high-risk bookings.
Optimize room allocation and pricing strategies based on cancellation trends and room type preferences.
Improve communication channels with customers to minimize uncertainties leading to cancellations.
